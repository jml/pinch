# pinch: a todo.txt UI

A [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/) command-line interface.

## Goals

This isn't really for you. This a toy project to let me play around with a few
Python libraries.

It's also an attempt to let me tweak the behaviour of todo.txt to suit my own
preferences.

## Libraries of interest

* [pyrsistent](http://pyrsistent.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
* [effect](https://github.com/radix/effect)
